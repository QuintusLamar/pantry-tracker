# pantry-tracker
The pantry tracker app is an app meant to keep track of your pantry. Whenever you go to the grocery store, you never know what you have at home. Sometimes you have to call a family member, or a roommate, or maybe you live alone and you just have to hope you're not buying something you already own. With the pantry tracker, you can just open the app, look up your item, and you will know if you already have it or not.
